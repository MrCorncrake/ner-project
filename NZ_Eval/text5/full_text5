The South Island contains a little under one-quarter of the population. Over three-quarters of New Zealand's population live in the North Island, with half living north of Lake Rotorua,
[68] and one-third of the total population living in the Auckland Region.[69]
Auckland is also the fastest growing region, accounting for 51% of New Zealand's total population growth (in the two decades up to 2016).[70] The majority of the indigenous Māori
people live in the North Island (87%), although a little under a quarter (24%) live in Auckland. New Zealand is a predominantly urban country, with 83.6% of the population living
in an urban area. About 64.4% of the population live in the 20 main urban areas (population of 30,000 or more) and 43.1% live in the four largest cities of Auckland, Christchurch,
 Wellington, and Hamilton.[69] (Other major urban areas include Tauranga, Dunedin, and Palmerston North.) New Zealand's population density of around 19 inhabitants per square kilometres
 (or 49 per sq mi)[69] is among the lowest in the world.[71]

New Zealand's peoples have been defined by their immigrant origin, the ongoing process of adaptation to a new land, being changed and changing those who came before. This process has
 led to a distinct distribution of culture across New Zealand. Here language and religion are used as markers for the far richer concept of culture. These metrics unfortunately exclude
  the political rural-urban divide[72] and also the full effects of the Christchurch earthquakes on New Zealand's cultural distribution.[73][74]

New Zealand's most widely spoken language is English (89.8%), however, language, dialect and accent varies spatially both within and between ethnic groups. The Māori language (3.5%)[1]
is spoken more commonly in areas with large Māori populations (Gisborne, Bay of Plenty and Northland).[75] There are many sub dialects of Māori, the most pronounced division being between
 the northern and southern tribes.[76] While migration (typically from north to south) was constant throughout the 16–18th centuries, the south maintained a distinct culture largely due to
 lack of cultivation possible at that latitude. English is spoken with regional accents relating to the origin of immigrants; for example Scottish and English 19th century immigration in
  Southland and Canterbury respectively.[77][78] This has also occurred with more recent immigration, with a wide variety of accents being common in larger cities where immigrant groups have
  preferentially settled. These immigrant groups change location with time and accents fade over generations.[79][80]

A wide variety of other languages make up the remaining approximately 6 percent of New Zealanders—with Samoan, Hindi, French and various Chinese dialects being the most common.[1]
These minority foreign languages are concentrated in the main cities, particularly Auckland where recent immigration groups have settled.[81]

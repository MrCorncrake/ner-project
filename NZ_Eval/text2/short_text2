New Zealand had few military towns. From the 1840s fortifications were erected in towns like Auckland, Whanganui and New Plymouth to resist M훮ori attack, but trade remained their life blood.
The 1860s New Zealand wars led to the founding of small towns like P훮tea, where two large Crown redoubts were erected.
Hamilton also began as a military post, and became a hub for the P훮keh훮 colonisation of Waikato.

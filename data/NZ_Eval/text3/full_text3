Aoraki Mount Cook National Park, New Zealand

Natural Wonders in Australia

Also known as Aoraki, 3,724-metre Mount Cook on New Zealand’s South Island is the country’s highest mountain, famously conquered by Sir Edmund Hillary before he took on Mount Everest.
The mountain lies within the alpine national park of the same name, with glaciers and snowfields amidst the neighbouring peaks, many of which are over 3,000 metres.
This is also where Tasman Glacier can be found, New Zealand’s longest at 27 kilometres and reaching an elevation of 3,000 metres above sea level.

Tongariro National Park, New Zealand

Natural Wonders in Australia

As New Zealand’s oldest national park, and the fourth to be established worldwide, as well as a UNESCO World Heritage Site,
 expectations of Tongariro National Park are bound to be high; luckily, even the highest of hopes are sure to be met here.
 Encompassing both cultural and natural wonders, the park is home to active volcanoes, alpine lakes and Maori cultural sites,
  with hot springs and lava flows to stumble upon as well. If any of the scenery seems familiar, it may be due to its role as a filming location for Lord of the Rings.

Also known as Aoraki, 3,724-metre Mount Cook on New Zealand’s South Island is the country’s highest mountain, famously conquered by Sir Edmund Hillary before he took on Mount Everest.
The mountain lies within the alpine national park of the same name, with glaciers and snowfields amidst the neighbouring peaks, many of which are over 3,000 metres.
This is also where Tasman Glacier can be found, New Zealand’s longest at 27 kilometres and reaching an elevation of 3,000 metres above sea level.

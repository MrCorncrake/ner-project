Since most non-Maori New Zealanders came from the United Kingdom, they looked to place names to create a sense of home and proclaim their membership of the British Empire.
Military and colonial history

Heroes of the Empire's battles were recalled in such place names as Auckland, Eden, Rodney, Raglan, Clive, Napier, Hastings, Havelock, Wellington, Picton, Marlborough, Nelson, Collingwood,
and Wyndham (after the Crimean War general Windham). Famous battlefields of empire - Blenheim, Waterloo and Trafalgar - also feature. The Scots explorer David Livingstone gave his name to
two localities, a bay and a mountain range.

Britain's literary heritage is represented by Spenser (mountains), Tennyson (a lake and inlet) and Chaucer and Milton bays. Napier named its streets after literary figures and Shakespere
[sic] was an early name for the Avon River in Christchurch. Waverley was the name of Sir Walter Scott's first historical novel.

Contemporary British politicians were honoured: Russell, Howick, Palmerston, Peel, Gladstone and Herbert. Cromwell recalled a historic leader.

The Clarence River may be named after the Duke of Clarence, later King William IV.

Victoria was briefly the name for Waitangi. Today both Auckland and Wellington have Mt Victorias, and there is a Victoria Range and River.

Governors gave their names to Hobson County north of Auckland (now part of Kaipara District), Bowentown in Bay of Plenty,
Gore (after Thomas Gore Browne), and Ranfurly.
